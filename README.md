# Chicago Crime Prediction
A study of how crime can be predicted in the city of Chicago using artificial intelligence. The following project entailed:

- Performing a comparative analysis on theft prediction using multiple models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost), all trained on a publicly available dataset hosted on https://catalog.data.gov/.

- Writing a research paper to summarise all findings, as well as to document the analysis, data transformation, and modelling phases that led to said findings.

- The paper was presented at the [SKILL 2023](https://skill.gi.de/) and won the Best Paper award. It is currently available [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.13464).
